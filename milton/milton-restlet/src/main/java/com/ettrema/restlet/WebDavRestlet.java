/**
 * Calls Milton HttpManager#process(request, response), adapting Restlet#handle(request, response)
 * <p>
 * This is only a frontend adapter, like Milton Servlet. Resources are still obtained with a
 * Milton <code>ResourceFactory</code>, which you have to provide to construct this adapter.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Resource implementations are not Restlet resources and have no access to the Restlet environment.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Limitation: A <code>GetableResource</code> can not access the global <code>HttpManager.request()</code>
 * and <code>HttpManager.response()</code> variables in its <code>sendContent()</code> method! Writing content
 * is deferred in a Restlet environment and not in the scope of <code>HttpManager.process()</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Limitation: Exceptions thrown by <code>GetableResource#sendContent()</code> may not have the desired
 * effect. Restlet will log an INFO message for an <code>IOException</code> i,f it was caused by a broken
 * client connection. Other exceptions, even NotAuthorizedException, BadRequestException, NotFoundException,
 * will be logged SEVERE, and an attempt is made to send an internal error response to the client (might be
 * too late, if the status was already sent). In other words, don't authorize, check for bad requests, or
 * produce "not found" in the <code>GetableResource#sendContent()</code> method. Do it earlier.
 * </p>

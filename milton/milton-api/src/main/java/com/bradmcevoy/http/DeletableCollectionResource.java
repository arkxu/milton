/**
 * An extension to DeletableResource and CollectionResource, this interface
 * adds a method to support efficient detection of child locks.
 *<P/>
 * This interface ONLY needs to be implemented by those who need to improve
 * performance of deleting collections
 *<P/>
 * In the case of deleting a collection resource it might be inefficient to
 * check for locks by recursively walking through the collection. By implementing
 * this interface you have the ability to use a more efficient approach
 *
 * See HandlerHelper.isLockedOut for an example of checking for locks:
 *<P/>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *     public boolean isLockedOut( Request inRequest, Resource inResource ) {
 *       if( inResource == null || !( inResource instanceof LockableResource ) ) {
 *           return false;
 *       }
 *       LockableResource lr = (LockableResource) inResource;
 *       LockToken token = lr.getCurrentLock();
 *       if( token != null ) {
 *           Auth auth = inRequest.getAuthorization();
 *           String lockedByUser = token.info.lockedByUser;
 *           if( lockedByUser == null ) {
 *               log.warn( "Resource is locked with a null user. Ignoring the lock" );
 *               return false;
 *           } else if( !lockedByUser.equals( auth.getUser() ) ) {
 *               log.info( "fail: lock owned by: " + lockedByUser + " not by " + auth.getUser() );
 *               String value = inRequest.getIfHeader();
 *               if( value != null ) {
 *                   if( value.contains( "opaquelocktoken:" + token.tokenId + ">" ) ) {
 *                       log.info( "Contained valid token. so is unlocked" );
 *                       return false;
 *                   }
 *               }
 *               return true;
 *           }
 *       }
 *       return false;

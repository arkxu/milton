/**
 * Represents a means of writing entities to the HTTP response. For most
 * containers this is trivial, simply write to the output stream on the Responsee
 * 
 * However, some containers have an architecture where the content transmission can
 * be deferred, and this abstraction exists to support that.
 * 
 * For example, Restlet uses an API with deferred content transmission. But also
 * SEDA (http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~mdw/proj/seda/) servers generally will want
 * to use a seperate thread pool for generating content from that which processes
 * request headers etc

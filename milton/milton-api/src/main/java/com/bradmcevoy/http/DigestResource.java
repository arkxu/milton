/**
 * Interface to support digest HTTP authentication.
 * <P/>
 * This provides an authentication method compatible with digest. The key
 * difference between this and Basic authentication is that the password
 * is not available in the request. What is sent is a one way hash of
 * several factors. To check the validity of a message, you must calculate
 * the same one way hash on the server
 * <P/>
 * Milton never requires a plain text password so the complete digest is passed
 * on to the resource implementation. You may choose to store the plain text password
 * , or you might choose to store a one hash of a subset of the digest auth
 * factors for greater security.
 * <P/>
 * Either way you SHOULD use the DigestGenerator class to calculate the hash
